<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:18px">
No Objection Certificate for the setting up of the petrol pump in the district is given as per provision contained in Rule 144(Chapter VII) of the Petroleum rules, 1976 framed under the Petroleum Act, 1934 and the instruction issued by the Director-Cum-Special Secretary Food & Supplies,Govt. of Punjab ,Chandigarh vide memo No IS(532-Lnd)2000/3236 dated 5-9-2000 by the District Magistrate of the concerned district. The DM after obtaining the NOC''s from various allied departments gives the final NOC for installing the petrol pump in the district.<br>
<h3>Why noconlinepunjab.com???</h3>
The earlier process which was adopted to provide the final NOC to the applicant was all manual and cumbersome. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify; font-size:20px;">The earlier system involved:<br>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Undue Delay</li><br>
  <li>Lack of transparency</li><br>
  <li>Ineffective Monitoring</li><br>
  <li>Undue harassment of the applicant to know the whereabouts of his case.</li>
  </ol>
  
 <h3> What New does the web portal has to offer???</h3>
  <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:18px">Thus in order to streamline the process and to provide a better interface between the applicant, departments and DC Office in issuing NOC for petrol pump a blend of technology was merged with the existing system thus giving birth to this new portal.<br>
  Now with this the applicant will register online and push all his documents required by departments for verification online only by scanning the manual file and then uploading it, which will be automatically forwarded to the concerned department. After the verification according to the respective guidelines of each department the department will push their report online to this web portal through their logins. Once the department has uploaded the NOC or any other correspondence the applicant will be able to view it in his account as well as in public domain. The same information will also be available to the public as to how many applications were received in a particular time span, how many departments have given their NOC and how many are pending at what level.<br><br>
  Thus the aim is to provide an easy, user friendly technology based module, which can assist the applicant, departments and DC Office to streamline the workflow of providing NOC for petrol pump.
  <h2 align="center">Thus getting an NOC should "No More Be a Pain, But an Experience Which Everybody Can Share About".</h2></p>
